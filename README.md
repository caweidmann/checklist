# checklist

In no particular order, here are things to remember:
- asynchronous loading of images, gifs, videos, gadtes etc.
- notification if javascript is disabled
- only load data necessary to display contents
- obvious, consistent navigation
- bigger text, less text
- links to more complete information (e.g. read more)
- obvious links and headings
- printer friendly pages (CSS)
