# checklist

In no particular order, here are things to remember:

## front-end

- asynchronous loading of images, gifs, videos, gadtes etc.
- notification if javascript is disabled
- only load data necessary to display contents
- obvious, consistent navigation, links and headings
- bigger text, less text
- links to more complete information (e.g. read more)
- printer friendly pages (CSS)

## team

- it's better to work together
- don't underestimate your peers
- don't assume people are dumb
- do things once properly or fail quickly & cheaply
- not everybody needs to know everything
- not everyone's job is equally "difficult", that doesn't mean the "easy" jobs are less important! everything has its place

## general

- learn to laugh about your failures and mistakes
