# A random checklist

In no particular order, here are things to remember:

## Front-end

- Always load images, gifs, videos etc. asynchronously
- Notification if JavaScript is disabled
- Only load data necessary to display contents
- Obvious, consistent navigation, links and headings
- Bigger text, less text
- Links to more complete information (e.g. read more)
- Printer friendly pages (CSS)
- Build code that is independant of interface

## Team

- It's better to work together
- Don't underestimate your peers
- Don't assume people are dumb
- Not everybody needs to know everything
- Not everyone's job is equally "difficult" - that does not mean the "easy" jobs are less important! Everything has its place

## Random

- Learn to laugh about your failures and mistakes
- Rub your ears outward till warm & red, this increases hearing instantly and increases concentration
- Drink a glass of water to help concentrate (brings oxygen to the brain)
